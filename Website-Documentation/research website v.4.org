* Research Library

** Drafted blurbs for 4/6 sections
*** Current text published on site must be reviewed by Joe to ensure it is on brand and in line with his vision
*** Will also present updated site to team to ensure everyone is briefed on progress

** Maintained keyword density
*** currently at a 0.61, experimented a bit to see impact on SEO 
*** with 2 more mentions the SEO hits 86, with 6 more mentions the SEO hits 89 (no way to make this natural, will continue to experiment)

** Included an external link (journal of consumer research under marketing blurb)
*** Boosted SEO from 79 to 85 and resolved most SEO Errors with exception of ToC - which we established is not recognized w/o plug-in - as well as Keyword Density and Word Count

** Added a Cover to the website's end which raised SEO by a single point - replacement for previously removed closing section
*** Image is in-line with NOVA aesthetic, and arguably makes webpage formatting more natural but can be done away with depending on preference

** Updated back-up webpage to ensure progress wasn't lost when editing using Divi Builder

* Next Steps

** Get SEO to 90 at least
*** Already experimented with keyword density + word count (at 2500 words SEO gets up to 88 but the density is impacted)
*** Finish final two blurbs, attempt natural mention of keyword 
*** Possibly implement another image or video (debatable only because more media would interrupt the simple formatting i've opted for)
*** Begin creating - as well as formatting - six new webpages with support from Marwa and link to them as well (can vary types of links which may impact SEO)

** Schedule time to collaborate with Marwa and determine how best to approach new webpages

** Update team on progress and present page as is before presentation

** Have text on webpage cleared by Joe
