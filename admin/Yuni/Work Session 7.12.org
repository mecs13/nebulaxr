* Work Session Sunday 7.12
** Yuni & Yuhao

*Discussed*

- Repeat indicence of system crash causing corrupt project file and Unreal program files
- Yuni verifies and reinstalls EPIC / Unreal. Issue narrowed to conflicting software due to multiple (back up) copies of project file coexisting; back up files moved to external HD; all older backups deleted.
- Yuni decides that the current project file is too bloated to work efficiently, opts to rebuild from scratch instead (SUCCESS)
- Complications on Yuni's end attempting to reconnect to Source Control
- Issues merging Yuhao's systems project with Yuni's build -- Yuhao must test for compatibility.
- Decision is made to use two separate demos in the morning and marge later in the week.

*Next Steps*

- Yuni finishes build for presentation Mon morning
- Yuni takes screenshots of finished build and shares with team on Discord
- Yuhao prepares to present systems demo in the morning
