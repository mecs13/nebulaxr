* Work Session Thurs 7.09
** Yuni & Yuhao

*Discussed*
- Lighting issues becoming insurmountable...
- Current build expanded by Yuni -- bridges replaced with platforming obstacles (objects & islands)
- Current build design (space and seasonal concepts) abandoned by Yuni
- Yuhao is building and testing Currency System 
- Yuhao building Save State

*Next Steps*
- Yuni does research on basic lighting in Unreal and implements her findings.
- Possibly replace space theme...new sky sphere?
- Experiment with and implement a new system of skylighting, directional lighting, and spot lighting.
- Yuni to speak with Joe on Friday concerning direction of build - ask for ideas.
- Yuni does a concept sketch for the new structure of the build -- reduce gamification burden - make it simpler for non gaming users.
