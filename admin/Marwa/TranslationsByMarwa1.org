My message to the world is an ignorant letter.

Alright... wha--

A message only... A message to the Palestinian people or for...

Whatever you please. To the Americans, Palestinians, the whole world. Do you speak English?

No. no. English, no.

Okay, go ahead.

This message is one of many that I will share with the world. The first message is to the separated Arab community who are fighting against themselves...

Talk about a peaceful message.

Peaceful message? That's all... ohh. I said bye to peace a long time ago. I want war.

Later.

Ahh...Hahaha. Okay. In the beginnning, with the opening of this message, I hope that the world will see what is happening here and loook at the Palestinian community as they are still under colonization, because we still are under colonization and have been for more than 70 years. The last colonization on Earth, is the Israeli colonization of Palestine. We wish for the world to reunite against Israeli politics and end this colonization; we also wish to put in place a free Palestine which will be free for all people.

That's beautiful.

Thank you.
