* Strategy

** Overview
- Objective
- Audience
- Timing 
- What we'll do
- Why they care

# 2-4 lines


** Execution 

# 5-9 numbered one-liners

# Differnt strategy for type of build (hut vs estate vs building)  -- view references in boilers:bricks



# This sells the entire document - start to finish how the program will work.  Each step is dependant on the last.  We begin with their aim (objective), and end with quantifying the achievement of their aim (objective + KPIs)


# Show how we set up the XR player's journey, provide it and follow up.  Why we take each step should be answered inherently by the next step.  

# The journey does NOT end with a purchase, that is the beggining of /netowrk marketing/ (share), and a prequel to the expansion (evolve) of the work.   Like in billiards, we must set up the next shot.   

# 1 page maximum

*** Fragment (Hunt)
*Objective* Produce a piece of content
1) Planning
2) Set up
3) test set up
4) make adjustments
5) finalize shot sheet
6) shoot
7) post produce
8) Publish
*** Production (House)
*Objective* Produce a complete XR experience
*** Campaign (Building)
*Objective* Drive sales, traffic, attention of sorts
*** Department/Business (Complex)
*Objective* Develop an experience, bring it to market, and scale it with a team



# The "How"
- Awareness
- interest
- Action 
- Commitment
- Share 
- Measure (quantifying the key performance indicators)
- Expand (evolve)

** Evolution of Development

# 1-3 lines per year

- Year 1, what we will do for them and why they care (protype/MVP)
- Year 2, what we will do for them and why they care (Full application)
- Year 3, what we will do for them and why they care (AR)
- Consider platform deployment

# Have additional features menued and priced so they can buy a little more than the yearly investment

# Long before the campaign is over we prepare them for the next buy.  When selling the next campaign, they will be happy with what we DID for them, but that is NOT a reason to buy again. The only reason to buy is what we WILL do for them next...

* User Experience

** VR Experience
- Where is the person when they hear about the VR
- What/when do they become interested
- why how do they put on the VR headset
- what do they see
- what happens/what do you do
- Then what and why
- What is the rising actioning, climax and conclusion of the experience
- what are the take aways/action items
- where/what/how does the follow up or continuation of experience occur



# Story that explains the audience's journry from start to finish, demonstrating the strategy, objective achievement and KPI in play.

** Act 1
- Setting, Scene, Characters
- where the XR is played (distribution)

** Act 2, 
- Rising Action, Character Development, Climax
- What the XR is (hardware, software used and types of content [photogram? CG models]
- how they learn

** Act 3
- Resolution
- KPIs, ROI (what was learned)

# the user shuold understand what is happening to the VR player before, during and after they put on the headset. 

# Evolution of emotions and the learning process.  

# Reader questions should be evoked and then answered (excpet maybe one or two subtle Qs).  

# Read and identify with the player, his plight and the journey. 

# Reflection of the /strategy/ and the sales (or function) funnel.

* Production Pipeline
In written words we introduce the Design, Develop, and Deployment 

** Design 

This process begins with collaboration between client and us. Outlining the project from start to finish, thinking through all details and components. 

# Design 3-10.  (analyzing, conceptualizing, innovating)
Deliverables -- objects, architectures, interface, microarchiteture, encironemtn)


- *Team Member* and skills 
- *Features* they insist on and descriptions
-- List of design deliverables 
** Programming
- software and hardware plans
- team to produce (physics simulations, lighting, textures, object interaction, interface, web GL, crypto, AI, haptic hardware, data scientist, ) 

# 4-10 lines
*tech arch image*
- worflow
- labels
- links

# graphic of hardware, software, middleware, protocols, /et cetera/, and how they relate or connect to each other

** Distribution

- where we publish and why
- how we promoteo it and why
- partnerships, media, contesting and other relavent information

# Advertising can be boiled down to reaching The right people with the right message at the right frequency. 
# 3-6 touch points are typically the sweet spot.
